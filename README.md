# SenseNet Simple ReactApp

It is my first react application to test sensenet api feature. This simple app can connect to a sensenet repository, show cartegories on a menu, list articles of selected category and show article. Show queries defined by smartfolders in sensenet repository.

From environment variable it can manage multiple sites.

It works with a fixed skin.

There is no user handling and login, yet.
